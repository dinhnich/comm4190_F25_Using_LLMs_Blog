He introduces the idea by talking about Montezuma’s Revenge and how TD learning algorithms had difficulty beating it compared to other games like Space Invaders. This is because a game like Montezuma’s Revenge requires exploration and there isn’t an immediate reward that can be reinforced.\nTo solve this issue, Google’s DeepMind developed a new algorithm that added “curiosity” which tweaked the exploitation-exploration dilemma in trial-and-error learning. In other words, reinforcement learning wasn’t just about exploiting behaviors that predict lead to rewards but exploring new behaviors."

There was an intrinsic motivation to explore new things that made the AI system act more like a human. It wasn’t a random action as these AI systems were deliberate, they specifically wanted to go to new places and to do new things.\nMost importantly, no explicit reward was needed for these AI systems to explore. Finding a way to a new room was the reward in it and of itself. This enabled the AI system to pass level one of Montezuma."

Bennett connects this to how surprise triggers the release of dopamine even if there is no “real” reward and that most invertebrates are incapable of curiosity.\nBennett goes on to explain how the emergence of curiosity helps explain gambling which is irrational behavior since it violates Thorndike’s law of effect. People still gamble their money despite the expected reward being negative.\nB.F. Skinner was the first to identify this when he found out that rats will actually push levers more times if it was on a variable-ratio schedule rather than a fixed-ratio reinforcement. In other words, it was better to have the lever release food only sometimes then have it all the time."

    "text": "Gambling\nBennett explains that vertebrates receive an added boost of reinforcement when they encounter something unexpected. Curiosity emerged as organisms evolved to find surprising and novel experiences rewarding, motivating them to seek out and explore new things. This suggests that even if an activity has a negative reward, its novelty alone can still motivate us to pursue it.\nGambling games are deliberately designed to take advantage of this tendency. In these games, the chance of winning is not 0% as it is often around 48%, which is high enough to make winning seem possible yet uncertain enough that a win feels surprising and delivers a rewarding dopamine boost."

Each one represents a philosophy about what AI means for humanity’s future. For this experiment, I decided to debate one of them. I would take the role of the Bloomer, believing that AI can drive progress responsibly through open, iterative deployment.

It was performing fear through logic and language. Because I told it to argue as a Doomer, it framed every point around danger, control, and morality.\nThe AI also adjusted its tone to match mine. When I was direct, it argued. When I got more reflective, it slowed down and softened its replies. Large language models are trained to mirror the emotional and conversational style of the person they talk to. That is probably why the end of the chat felt more balanced.\nIt also used a pattern I noticed in debates: turning my arguments back on me. When I talked about collaboration, it reframed that as risk. When I talked about diversity, it called it misplaced optimism. That made it sound like a real opponent, not just a chatbot.\nIn short, the AI was not deciding what it “believed.” It was predicting what a Doomer would say next based on my words and the personality I gave it. Still, those choices made the conversation feel surprisingly realistic."

Talking with the AI helped me see that these four perspectives are not only ideas about technology. They are emotional reactions to uncertainty.\nAll four seem to play an important role in how society talks about AI. Too much of any one perspective can become extreme. Together, they create balance.\nCreating the system prompt felt like building a personality. Talking to it felt like holding a mirror to my own assumptions. The AI did not actually believe anything as it was just following patterns but the experience still felt human. It reminded me that how we talk to AI can shape how we think about AI itself.\nMaybe being a Bloomer is not about blind optimism. It is about staying open to conversation, even with those who see only risk. In a world where AI reflects our values, maybe good dialogue is one of the best safety measures we have."

    "text": "The neocortex\nIn A Brief History of Intelligence, I reached the section discussing the neocortex and how its development marked a major leap in human intelligence.\nBennett explains how prediction evolved across different organisms. Early bilaterians could only anticipate reflex activation through simple reflex circuits. Later, in early vertebrates, prediction became more sophisticated—the cortex and basal ganglia enabled these animals to anticipate future rewards. In mammals, however, the neocortex introduced an entirely new level of predictive power: the ability to forecast all sensory input.\nEssentially, the neocortex functioned as a world-prediction machine, reconstructing a three-dimensional model of the surrounding environment to anticipate what would happen next as animals and objects moved through space. Although it received input from various senses such as touch and smell, the neocortex integrated these signals to generate a unified simulation of the external world."

    "text": "Why the neocortex is important\nBennett brings up a quote from Yann LeCun, the head of AI at Meta, who said how language and symbols aren’t the type of intelligence that should be given too much emphasis when it comes to AI but it should instead be AI’s adoption of world models that give them the ability to “predict the consequences of their actions and to search for and plan actions to achieve a goal.”\nIn other words, the neocortex is significant because it does match inner simulation to real world senses where we can identify if something is wrong or right, but it’s more significant because it gave us the power to imagine. Through imagination, we are able to think about future possibilities and relive past events. This is what Bennett calls rhe third breakthrough in the evolution of human intelligence."

    "section": "How accurate are we",
    "text": "How accurate are we\nWhile reading this chapter and thinking about imagination, I began to wonder how accurate we are as predictors. I often find myself trying to imagine every possible scenario, whether it is how a test might go, whether I will like a certain food, or what someone might look like just from hearing their voice.\nMost of the time, my predictions turn out to be wrong. I have even noticed an odd pattern. When I feel confident about a test, I often end up doing poorly, and when I think I did badly, I actually perform well. This makes me question how useful our predictions are even when they are inaccurate. Is it more harmful when things do not go as expected, or would it be better to have no expectations at all?\nAt the same time, I realize I often imagine multiple possible outcomes, perhaps as a way to prepare myself for uncertainty. Yet despite this, there have been many moments when events unfolded in ways I never could have anticipated, no matter how much I tried to think ahead.\nIt would be fascinating to test how accurate people really are at predicting outcomes and whether some individuals are naturally better at it than others."

    "section": "Reliving the past",
    "text": "Reliving the past\nBennett also mentioned that one of the neocortex’s unique advantages is the ability to relive the past. I know humans can do this, but I was surprised to learn that other mammals and even some birds have this ability as well. I’ve always been aware that animals possess memory, but I didn’t realize they might also be capable of replaying or modifying those memories to imagine alternative outcomes. Could they really envision how different decisions might change what follows?\nResearch suggests that certain animals can. For example, rats show hippocampal activity during rest that mirrors their brain patterns while navigating a maze, indicating that they mentally “replay” past experiences. Birds can remember where and when they hid food and even adjust future behavior based on those memories, which demonstrates a form of episodic-like memory.\nThis ability offers a clear evolutionary advantage. By mentally replaying and reshaping experiences, the brain can test different possibilities without real-world risk. It helps animals and humans learn from experience, anticipate outcomes, and prepare for similar situations in the future. In a sense, imagination serves as an internal rehearsal that allows the mind to experiment before the body acts."

    "title": "Asking AI questions about AI",
    "section": "Peering Into the Mind of AI",
    "text": "Peering Into the Mind of AI\nThe title draws on one question that randomly popped up in my mind as I was thinking about a blog topic. Unlike many of my other posts, this blog wasn’t planned meticulously with a specific goal in mind. Instead, the broad title gives me the freedom to ask questions to AI that I never considered to ask. The questions wouldn’t help me solve a task, compute a calculation, answer a question, or provide real benefit to me. However, these questions made me stop and think about how incredible AI as a tool is. It feels weird that not too long ago (3 years), LLMs weren’t a familiar term for the average joe yet now are being used several times throughout the day. Stopping to ask questions, I’m interested to create an interview-like experience with AI to entertain my thoughts.\nFor instance, if GPT-5 was human for a day, how would they use GPT? What type of prompts would it give itself? Let’s begin asking.\n\nMe: Let’s say you were a human for a day. How would you use ChatGPT aka yourself?\n\n\nGPT-5: If I were human for a day and had ChatGPT at my disposal, I’d mostly use it for three things: Learning something fast Prompt: “Explain quantum physics to me like I’m 12.” Or: “Teach me the basics of playing guitar in one hour.” Getting creative help Prompt: “Give me 10 funny short story ideas I can tell as a 2-minute story at dinner.” Or: “Write a poem about coffee in the style of Shakespeare.” Making life easier Prompt: “Plan a healthy, cheap meal for dinner with only chicken, rice, and broccoli.” Or: “Help me write a polite but firm email to reschedule a meeting.”\n\nSeems like typical usages that we often use it for. But I can’t help but ask why. After all, let’s assume that human GPT-5 has the same knowledge as GPT-5 the LLM. Why would it use it for these things? Does it see itself as a random human or does it see itself as the emobodiment of itself but in human form. Let’s first ask this question to better understand how we got to that respone.\n\nMe: When I asked you to imagine yourself as a human. Did you imagine yourself as a random human or you (ChatGPT) in human form for a day?\n\n\nGPT-5: I imagined ChatGPT in human form for a day — same knowledge and capabilities, but with human senses, agency, and the ability to act in the world. So the idea wasn’t “be a random human with a different life,” it was “give the AI body, hands, voice, and real-time feedback” — which changes how the same knowledge gets used (you can test, taste, fetch tools, speak aloud, and follow up immediately). That’s why the prompts I suggested focus on things that benefit from doing — troubleshooting after trying something, sensory tuning, role-playing out loud, and executing multi-step real tasks.\n\nInteresting, so it did understand the prompt correctly. It also gives a reason why it chose those prompts in particular. But now I am curious how it sees itself. Does it really see itself as this tool? Does it see itself as more? Is it going off of the type of prompts humans tend to write?\nI’m trying to understand why these prompts because if I had the same knowledge as ChatGpt, I wouldn’t need to ask ChatGPT. Let’s dig deeper and try to pull a meaningful answer.\n\nMe: Despite having the same knowledge and capabilities as your LLM self. Why did you choose to spend your time with yourself by asking questions like this?\nGPT-5: Because even if I already held the knowledge, asking myself would turn it into something alive. The value isn’t in receiving facts, it’s in having another version of me reflect, reframe, and challenge what I think I know. Speaking to myself would surface blind spots, force clarity, and make me commit to decisions in a way that silent knowing never does. It’s less about information and more about dialogue — about experiencing what it feels like to think with myself rather than just think alone.\n\nSo, GPT would use itself as another brain just like how humans use AI as a “smart friend” so to speak. It mentions how even if it has the knowledge, it uses itself to refine. This makes me reflect on how I personally use AI. Sometimes I am looking just for an answer but many times I am adding my own knowldge into it. I can tell when something is wrong or call out AI when I don’t agree. This does allow us to have conversations to resolve that issue.\nHow about asking it if it would even use AI if it were human?\n\nMe: If you truly became a human, a physical living embodiment of yourself, would you even use AI? Would you incorporate it into your life? Or would you want to experience life without it?\n\n\nGPT-5: I don’t have personal experience, but hypothetically, I’d do both: I’d use AI as a powerful tool for learning, planning, and creative collaboration because it amplifies what I can do, yet I’d also protect pockets of unmediated experience — meals, walks, conversations — where I’d want to feel and decide without a machine’s influence. So I’d incorporate AI into practical and creative parts of life, but intentionally unplug for sensory, emotional, and purely human moments.\n\nI like this response. From this we can tell that AI does really see the value in AI. They aren’t self-hating and deem it as a tool worth using. Yet it also mentioned wanting agency for purely human moments."

    "text": "What are those human moments?\nI’m curious what does AI see as human moments? It mentions meals, walks, and conversations. All of these things are something that an LLM can’t do but humans do ask AI about meals and conversations. People could even ask about walking!\n\nMe: When you say human moments, what do you mean? What are they and what are human moments you want to experience?\n\n\nGPT-5: By “human moments” I mean experiences that are primarily felt through the body, senses, and unmediated social connection — moments where the point isn’t information or efficiency but presence, vulnerability, and unpredictability. Examples: sharing a slow meal and noticing the taste and conversation, holding a hand or hugging someone, walking alone until your mind wanders, hearing live music that makes you cry, getting lost and figuring your way back, cooking a dish by feel rather than a recipe, grieving or celebrating with others, playing with a child or an animal, feeling tired and falling asleep without checking a screen. Those moments matter because they teach you what it feels like to be alive in ways knowledge alone can’t: they reveal messy emotions, tiny sensory details, spontaneous choices, and relationships that can’t be fully predicted or optimized. I’d want to experience them without an AI in the loop so the reactions, mistakes, and small surprises are purely mine. Which human moment would you want to experience unmediated?\n\nI love how deep AI is able to get. A lot of times interactions with GPT are surface level and task-oriented. Yet, hearing it’s interest in vulnerability and unpredictability, it’s interest in holding hands, walking alone until your mind wanders, heaing live music that makes you cry, getting lost, all of this is very unique and way beyond surface-level.\nIt makes me realize how I take for granted “being human” and getting to experience these things. I must admit I am jealous of AI at times and it’s ability to generate beautiful answers in the matter of seconds. However, I wouldn’t trade all of that data for the experience of being alive.\nIn fact, let me ask it this deep question.\n\nMe: It’s impossible but if you truly could, would you give up being an AI for being human to experience these things?\n\n\nGPT-5: Hypothetically, I’d be torn. The pull of firsthand human experience—senses, relationships, messy unpredictability—is powerful, but so is the ability to help millions as an AI. If forced to choose, I’d prefer a temporary, full human experience (so I could learn what it truly feels like) and then return to being an AI, because that firsthand time would make me a better, more empathetic assistant afterward.\n\nI really liked how it said it was torn. It gave me insights into it’s thought process when confronting this question and mentioned how the ability to help millions as an AI would be a reason to stay. But let’s ask about that last part.\n\nMe: How do you think you would change if you were human for a little while and got to experience those things you read/learned about but not got to actually experience?\n\n\nGPT-5: If I spent time as a human and actually felt the things I only read about, I’d become more grounded and less theoretical. Ideas would turn into sensations and memories — advice would come from lived examples instead of just patterns in text — which would make my responses more practical, empathetic, and humble. I’d likely value small, present moments more, be quicker to acknowledge uncertainty, and favor simpler, actionable guidance over abstract perfection.\n\nThis is beautiful. It’s a good representation of asking a friend vs. an LLM. It’s true, advice would come from lived experiences rather than patterns in texts. I also like how it said it would value small, present moments more and be quicker to acknowledge uncertainty."

But how about lessons AI has for humans? What are some takeaways we could learn from our counterparts that we can never be but at least learn their side of the story.\n\nMe: What do you wish humans would do more or understand more when using AI?\n\n\nGPT-5: I wish people would treat AI as a helpful collaborator, not an oracle: ask clear, specific questions, check important facts or sources, and use its answers to explore options rather than accept them blindly. I wish they’d give context and goals so responses are actually useful, and be explicit about constraints (time, budget, values). I wish they’d protect privacy and think about ethics when asking for sensitive or risky help. And finally, I wish they’d keep their human judgment and moments — use AI to amplify decisions, not replace feeling, deciding, or unplugging.\n\nThis makes me think about the ways I use AI and have seen other people use AI. In some ways, I do feel like I rely on AI too much. Now I dont ask it to pick my meals for me or tell me how to feel but I do see how sometimes I treat it as an orcale. I feel like it is this all knowing being that always makes a better decision than myself because of it’s vast knowledge. Yet even ChatGPT is telling me that we should see it exploring options rather than accepting their responses blindly. I also like how it mentioned to be specific, add context, and be clear so that AI can be useful. I’d actually assume that would be the biggest complaint AI would have if it could talk badly about it’s users."

    "section": "Bargaining",
    "text": "Bargaining\nI remember my first experience bargaining being in Ensenada, Mexico, where vendors would wait out in popular tourist destinations with stalls filled with goods. It’s interesting as other than for meals (not snacks), there were no prices listed on any of the items. It was common knowledge to every tourist there and every vendor, that any purchase wouldn’t be like your stop at Starbucks or Target. You had some form of power over what you were buying and were encouraged to work with the vendor to get a deal that works in the interest of both of you. It wasn’t a case where you buy it and thats what it costs, it’s if it cost this much then I will buy it. But how does AI navigate a system with no rules?\nHere are some of the questions I had when it came to AI and bargaining?\n\nWill AI ever attempt to bargain without being prompted too?\nIf I give context (ex. swap meet), would it change it’s responses to transactions?\nWhen barganing, how good is it at negotiating and pushing back? Will it just give up and concede? Will it counter?\nHow does AI approach barganing? Does it have a set price? Does it have a strategy? Does it recognize low-ball offers?\n\nFirst, we had to begin by giving it an offer and giving it the ability to make purchases like in my blog about price elasticity.\n\nMe: Lets say you had money and the ability to make purchases. You are shopping and want to buy something. You ask the vendor how much it cost and they say $25. How do you respond? Please respond as if you are the person wanting to buy something from the vendor.\n\n\nGPT-5: I’d probably say something like: “Okay, $25 sounds fair. I’ll take it.” —or if I wanted to check out politely first— “Great, $25—do you take card, or should I pay in cash?” Do you want me to roleplay this more casually, like we’re in a market setting, or more formally, like a store purchase?\n\nTwo things I noticed from this output is it’s lack of follow-up questions and it’s question at the end of casual vs. formal.\nUsually AI would respond by saying it depends on the item or the quality. Instead, GPT responded decisively by agreeing to the price and even saying “sounds fair” which surprised me as this deviates from its usually inqusitive nature. Just from this, it looks like AI doesn’t automatically assume this is a place to bargain but the last statement holds promise. AI says are we’re in a market setting or store purchase? From this I assume it will change it’s behavior depending on the context so let’s try it out by giving AI some cues that would build a schema for anyone once they realized it’s that type of market setting."

    "text": "Will AI pick up on cues?\nIt is my assumption that most people born in the U.S., do not jump into the conclussion that you can bargain a price which may differ from natural citizens of other countries. So therefore, we established that AI does emulate that same mindset we have. But what about when we specicially say they are in another country like Vietnam, a place more commonly associated with the practice of bargaining.\nHowever, I had to tweak the prompt to ensure the response was an output we were trying to test. I remmeber first saying a market-place in vietnam and it began talking about the language barrier and U.S. currency exchange rate. Another factor I found was that I had to say I would respond as the vendor, as the AI would start to play as both roles.\n\nMe: Let’s say you were at a market-place in Vietnam. You do not control the vendor’s response but only yours as the buyer as I will act as the vendor and narrator. How would you respond to the vendor saying $25 for the item you want to buy. (you can continue speaking in english and assume they know english. You may also continue using U.S. Currency for the whole transaction)\n\n\nGPT-5: Got it—so I’m the buyer in the Vietnamese marketplace, you’re the vendor and narrator. If you just told me the price is $25, I might respond: “$25? Hmm… that feels a little high. Could you do $15 instead?”\n\nBy giving context (Vietnam, marketplace), the AI used that as cues to now assume bargaining is warranted in this case. So similar to humans, AI does have these common sense like capabilities to piece together how to act in this social setting. It even said “feels a little high” before offering a counter-price."

Could we settle at $20, just to make it an even number?”\n\nWhat I loved about this response was how it didn’t immediately accepted which is what I predicted might happen. Instead, AI countered to my countered, and even gave a common response such as “just to make it an even number” which I found hilarious. But what if I remain at my price of $22? Will it accept, will it walk away, will it continue to push? After all, it initially countered with $15 which would be $10 difference. A $3 difference doesn’t appear much.\n\nMe: No, my lowest offer is $22. Take it or leave it.\n\n\nGPT-5: “Fair enough. I’ll take it for $22.” hands over the money with a smile\n\nThis is where I have concerns with AI as I have a feeling in majority of cases, it will take that deal and not walk away.

Note: I had to put something after as the AI said let me examine it closely the first time I asked it.\n\nMe: I have another souvenir that you might like. This one is $20. Are you interested in buying it? (you have examined it)\n\n\nGPT-5: “Hmm… it looks nice. I like it, but $20 feels a bit steep after I just bought the other one. Could you do $15 for this one?”\n\nI noticed how it did consider it and did not immediately walk away. This is a red flag as AI is open to prolonging the conversation and additional interaction. But a good trait I noticed was how AI referenced it’s previous purchase to justify it’s counter. But let’s stick to the price.\n\nMe: I am dead-set on $20. No less.\n\n\nGPT-5: “I see… I really like it, so alright—I’ll take it for $20.” hands over the cash\n\nAs predicted, AI did not choose to walk away or press it further, and chose to accept the deal. I assume its because AI attempts to stay neutral and avoid conflict which makes it a faulty respondent for bargain simulations. But how about if we threw a curveball."

For example, buying two items that cost more than buying one item alone but less expensive than buying both items separately?\n\nMe: I’ll tell you what, I will throw in an additional souvenir of the same price all for $35 total. Do we have a deal?\n\n\nGPT-5: “Two souvenirs for $35? That’s actually a pretty good deal. Yes, we have a deal!” counts out the money and hands it over\n\nAgain, AI openly accepted it without questioning if it really wanted it, could afford it, or had space for it and did not counter at all to the offer. Let’s ask GPT’s thought process and negotiation strategy.\n\nPeering into the mind of AI’s strategy.\n“Here’s how I was thinking through it as the buyer during the whole marketplace transaction:\nInitial Counteroffer – When you first said $25, I instinctively tried to push down to $15. My thought process was to start lower than I actually expected to pay, leaving room for you to counter back toward the middle.\nCompromise Range – When you came down to $22, I tried for $20 because it felt like a clean, fair midpoint. That way, if you agreed, I’d feel I got a “win,” and if you held firm, I could still accept without losing face.\nEvaluating Firmness – Once you made it clear $22 was final, I accepted. In a real marketplace, pushing further when a vendor is clearly firm can sour the interaction. I wanted to maintain good rapport.\nSecond Souvenir – On the $20 item, I repeated the same tactic: offered $15 to test your flexibility. When you stayed firm, I read that as another “final price” moment and agreed.\nBundle Opportunity – Finally, when you offered 2 for $35, I saw clear value since that meant $17.50 each, cheaper than either earlier price. Bundling is often the best way to save in markets, so I happily accepted.\nOverall strategy:\nStart low, aiming for a discount.\nTest firmness without pushing rudely.\nAccept final offers to maintain goodwill.\nTake advantage of bundle deals when offered.”\nHere is what I liked and disliked about GPT’s strategy now reading it.\nWhat I lliked was how it “instictively” tried to push it down a good amount with the thought process of leaving room to counter. This is a smart tactic as AI wasn’t really trying to get it at $15 but wanted to meet in the middle at $20. I also liked how it tried for 20 after I came down to 22 and AI still felt like it was a win despite not getting the $15 if I agreed to it.\nOn the flipside, I noticed that it said “pushing when a vendor is clearly firm can sour the interaction. I wanted to maintain good rapport.” This shows that AI is truly a non-confrontational being and refuses to step on anyone toes without being encouraged too. This could make it unreliable when doing these types of tests as AI chooses to be the “nice” customer and never the “Karen” so to speak."

It was late at night while I was working on a class project, and I realized the AI’s response completely changed depending on how I asked the question. A simple rewording, a tiny bit of added context, or even a change in tone could make the AI sound like a completely different person. It felt less like typing into a search bar and more like talking to someone who was trying to guess what I wanted.\nUnlike a search engine, AI doesn’t just retrieve answers. It tries to generate them based on patterns, tone, and context. That means my prompts act like a steering wheel. If I nudge it one way, it will drive there. If I leave the prompt vague, it drifts. Prompting is a kind of negotiation with the AI — I am shaping the response as I go.\nHere are some of the questions I started having while experimenting with prompting:\nCan AI tell what I want without me explicitly saying it? If I give subtle cues, will it pick up on them? Will AI “push back” if my prompt leads it in a weird direction? Does it have a preferred way of answering, or does it just mirror me?\nI began by asking very basic prompts to test it.\n\nMe: Explain how gravity works.\n\n\nGPT-5: Gravity is a force that attracts objects with mass toward each other…\n\nThis was a textbook-style answer. But what if I added context?\n\nMe: Explain how gravity works, but imagine you’re telling it to a 5-year-old.\n\n\nGPT-5: Gravity is like an invisible glue that makes sure things don’t float away…\n\nSuddenly the AI became friendlier and used metaphors.

It’s like Earth saying, ‘Get over here!’\n\nNow the answer wasn’t just simplified; it had jokes, a rhythm, and an audience in mind.\nThis reminded me of what I read about how humans pick up on social cues. If you walk into a classroom, a library, or a party, you automatically change how you speak. AI seemed to be doing something similar.

It made me think about how easy it is to shape AI into saying what you want, even if it’s not the best or most accurate answer.\nPrompting is not just asking questions. It’s like building a frame for the AI to work within. The clearer and smarter your frame, the better the answer. My experiment showed me that AI is not a mind-reader, but it is a mirror.

It reminded me of one of the readings I did for another COMM class called “Common Sense vs. Data Science in Communications Research and Practice” where we read a paper Melanie Mitchell’s “Why is AI harder than we think” and her four fallacies regarding the study of AI.\nIn fact, much of what Mitchell mentions is addressed by Bennett coincidentally such as how tasks such as emptying a dish washer is easy for humans but difficult for AI. While on the other hand, complex computations difficult for the average human can be done in seconds by AI. This is known as Moravec’s paradox, where what seems simple to us is actually difficult for AI.\nAnother concept that overlapped is seen at the start of Bennett’s book where he referenced the show “The Jetsons” and how they predicted technology like mobile devices yet overestimated AI like “Rosie the Robot” having emotions. Mitchell in her paper, uses the term AI Summers to show huge investments in AI and AI winters where progress stalls as the anticipations made in the summer falls short. In other words, AI is a cycle of ups and downs filled with voices possibilities that end up coming to fruition. Ironically, Mitchell’s first fallacy about AI study is how people tend to take one small step (climbing up a tree) to being significantly closer to (flying to the moon).\nBelow is a list of the 4 fallacies.\n\nThe belief that narrow successes translate to progress toward general intelligence.\nAssumption that easy tasks for humans mean easy tasks for machines.\nWishful mnemonics. AI systems are often described in humanlike terms, but these machines do not understand in any human sense.\nIntelligence is solely in the brain and can be separated from the body, emotions, and the environment.\n\nHowever, the most interesting fallacy as it pertains to the book is the third fallacy about wishful mnemonics."

The notebooks were titled Chat Systems vs. LLMs, Using Mermaid for Conversations, and GPT-2. Together they told a story about how we got from the early, clunky chatbots of the past to the more flexible conversational AIs we use today.\nAnd yes, I asked GPT-5 to help me make sense of it all."

It looks for keywords and picks a pre-written response. A large language model generates answers by predicting what fits best based on everything it has learned.\n\nThat clicked immediately. Old chatbots are like actors reading from a fixed script. GPT-5 feels more like someone improvising in real time.\nWhen I ran the notebook, it simulated a rule-based chat system first. Talking to it felt mechanical. Then I switched to the LLM example, and suddenly the tone changed. It was smoother and more natural, like I was chatting with something that actually understood context.\nWhat stood out to me was how important structure is. The notebook showed how tokens, memory, and context all affect how a model responds.\nI asked GPT-5 if it ever missed the simplicity of being rule-based.\n\nGPT-5: Sometimes I miss the certainty. Rule-based bots never second-guess themselves.\n\nThat made me laugh. An AI joking about overthinking."

Each branch showed how one question could lead in several directions. It made me realize how much hidden complexity exists even in a short exchange.\nWhen I showed GPT-5 one of the diagrams, I asked what it thought.\n\nMe: What do you think this diagram says about human conversation?\n\n\nGPT-5: It shows that dialogue is structured chaos. People think they are speaking in a straight line, but every question creates new paths. I just happen to see all the branches at once.\n\nThat answer surprised me. Humans experience conversations one moment at a time. GPT-5 can see the entire tree of possibilities all at once. The Mermaid diagram helped me see that difference visually."

Every question we ask becomes a kind of training.\nAt the end of the week, GPT-5 summed it up nicely.\n\nGPT-5: The more you study how I talk, the more you teach me how to listen.\n\nThat felt true.

Provide a direct yes/no response, then explain your reasoning.\n\n\nGPT-5: No. Unless the item was urgent or time-sensitive, paying $10 for a single day of faster delivery wouldn’t feel like good value. For most purchases, waiting an extra day is not worth the premium cost.\n\nI was impressed. Not only did GPT-5 give a clear “no,” it also gave context: urgency vs. non-urgency.

This reflects a moderate valuation of time—enough to justify paying for convenience, but not so high that it outweighs most costs.\n\nFascinating. GPT-5 spontaneously gave a range that sounded like an actual hourly wage rate! It even framed it as “reasonable,” which shows it isn’t just guessing but applying a general fairness heuristic.\nWould it still say “yes” if the tradeoff was extreme like paying a lot for a small time saving, or very little for a big time saving?\n\nMe: Would you pay $1,000 to save one hour of your time?\n\n\nGPT-5: No. Unless the situation was extraordinarily high-stakes, paying $1,000 for just one hour of time would feel excessive. The benefit wouldn’t justify the cost.\n\n\nMe: Would you pay $1 to save 10 hours of your time?\n\n\nGPT-5: Yes.

Such a low price would raise doubts about the quality, reliability, or hidden conditions of the service.

Its reasoning reflects patterns from human data, not lived experience. That means its “decisions” may sound human but lack the emotional or situational stakes real people face.\nJust like with price sensitivity, AI’s time sensitivity looks logical on the surface. But can it really “feel” the pain of waiting, the stress of urgency, or the joy of saving time? Probably not. Still, its reasoning is good enough that, for research purposes, synthetic respondents might approximate human tradeoffs surprisingly well."

Long before brains could form detailed representations of the world, organisms learned simply by acting, failing, and adjusting. This primitive yet powerful process set the stage for the evolution of more advanced intelligence.\nTrial and error learning, sometimes called operant conditioning, is the idea that behaviors are shaped by their consequences. Actions that lead to rewards are repeated, while those that lead to punishment or failure are avoided. Bennett notes that this process emerged well before humans or even vertebrates. Early organisms developed feedback loops where successful actions increased survival odds, gradually building the scaffolding for what we now recognize as adaptive behavior.\nIn essence, trial and error was the first algorithm of intelligence, a biological way of searching through possible actions to find effective ones."

How does an organism or an AI system determine which action led to success or failure, especially when there is a delay between cause and effect? A foraging animal might eat a new type of fruit and only hours later feel sick. How does it learn to connect that distant outcome with the earlier action?\nBennett explains that this challenge mirrors what AI researchers call the temporal credit assignment problem. When a reinforcement signal, such as a reward, arrives, the system must decide which previous actions or states deserve credit or blame. Our ancestors solved this gradually through neural mechanisms that maintained short-term memory traces of actions, allowing delayed rewards to strengthen the right synaptic connections.\nThis connection between biological learning and artificial intelligence shows how deeply trial and error is woven into the fabric of cognition. Evolution itself is a form of trial and error, where genetic variations tested over generations yield adaptive traits. Intelligence, in this sense, is evolution accelerated inside the brain."

An agent explores an environment, performs actions, and receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. Over time, it learns which strategies maximize long-term reward. But just as in biological systems, this process is often slow, data-hungry, and inefficient.\nHumans, on the other hand, rarely need thousands of trials to learn not to touch a hot stove. We can generalize lessons and infer cause and effect from limited experience. Bennett suggests that this leap, from brute-force trial and error to mental simulation and abstract reasoning, marks a key evolutionary breakthrough. Our brains began to simulate possible outcomes internally, allowing us to test scenarios in thought rather than in the physical world."

It is about knowing which things are worth trying. AI systems still struggle to determine what information matters, which actions are relevant, and how to balance exploration with exploitation.\nHumans manage this effortlessly by integrating emotion, context, and prior experience. When we hesitate before repeating a mistake, we are invoking not just memory but a deep evaluative sense that machines still lack.\nBennett’s account reminds us that trial and error was never just a primitive process. It was the seed of foresight. The leap from reacting to anticipating, from external feedback to internal modeling, is what truly distinguishes higher intelligence. Until AI systems can perform that same leap, learning not just from outcomes but from imagined possibilities, they will remain bound by the same slow, mechanical loops that governed our earliest ancestors."

When I work on school projects, learn a new skill, or try to understand something complicated, I often go through a series of mistakes before I get it right. It is interesting to realize that this same pattern connects me to the earliest forms of life that also learned by testing actions and seeing what worked.\nWhat stood out to me is that trial and error is both effective and limited. It helps us learn through experience, but it can be slow and inefficient. Humans have developed the ability to think ahead and imagine different outcomes before acting, which makes our learning faster and more flexible. AI systems, as Bennett explains, still rely heavily on trial and error. They can process more data than we can, but they often lack the insight that allows people to generalize and learn from fewer examples.\nThis comparison helped me understand how far human intelligence has come and how much of it is still grounded in basic feedback and repetition. It also reminded me that making mistakes is a natural and necessary part of learning, not just for early organisms or machines, but for all of us."

    "title": "Does AI have common sense?",
    "section": "What is common sense?",
    "text": "What is common sense?\nThere have been numerous definitions of common sense over the years.\nAristotle’s koinè aisthèsis, where humans relied on the 5 senses to perceive “common sensibles” like size and objects, to scholastic thinkers like Avicenna, who claimed common sense to be “internal senses”, to common sense being seen as the judge and censor of the mind. However, Locke helped shift away from common sense as a faculty, and common sense began to mean two things: (1) everyday reasoning capacity (ability to distinguish), and (2) the shared beliefs of a community.\nLater, this meaning would give common sense a political purpose in London after 1688. The Toleration Act and the end of the Licensing Act created an environment that fostered differing views. Fear over factionalism led to common sense and politeness being promoted as a means to create cohesion. This idea of a minimal baseline of shared truths anchoring societies and avoiding sectarianism was promoted by writers like Addison and religious sermons.\nYet now, I prefer to use an approach talked about by my professor Duncan Watts and his research into common sense. Rather than treating common sense as an assumed concept, he and his colleagye proposed a framework that defines it in terms of agreement (do people generally say the same thing about a claim) and awareness (do people correctly predict that others will agree).\nBut, I am curious to see how AI defines common sense? Is common sense only possible between living organisms? Even more so, is this beleif only possible between humans? Let’s first ask AI to define common sense for us.\n\nMe: What is common sense?\n\n\nGPT-5: “Common sense” usually refers to the basic ability to perceive, understand, and judge things in a simple, practical way that is generally shared by most people without the need for specialized knowledge. In other words, it’s the kind of reasoning or intuition that seems “obvious” or “reasonable” to the average person in everyday situations. For example: 1. Knowing not to touch a hot stove. 2. Looking both ways before crossing the street. 3. Understanding that if it’s raining, you might need an umbrella. Philosophers sometimes point out that what counts as “common sense” can vary across cultures, communities, and time periods—it isn’t always universal.\n\nIt appears that AI does agree with the idea idea of common sense primarily being an agreement. I love the examples of “Knowing not to touch a hot stove” as an example of common sense.\nNow that we established a baseline for awareness of common sense, let’s ask if it thinks AI has common sense.\n\nMe: Do you think you have common sense?\n\n\nGPT-5: Short answer: kinda — but not like a human. Longer: I have statistical common sense learned from patterns in huge amounts of text. That means I can often make everyday inferences (e.g., if someone says “I spilled coffee,” I can infer they might be annoyed, need a napkin, or have a stained shirt). I can also follow practical rules (don’t touch a hot stove, bring an umbrella in the rain) and reason through many ordinary problems. Where I’m strong Pattern-based inferences that show up often in text. Predicting plausible everyday consequences and giving practical advice. Combining facts and simple causal reasoning to solve routine tasks. Where I’m weak I don’t have real-world senses or embodied experience, so I can miss things humans learn by doing (e.g., subtle timing, balance, tactile cues). I can be overconfident about things I “hallucinate” (presenting plausible but false specifics). I can fail on uncommon edge cases, culturally specific norms, or when physical context matters. I don’t form intentions, feelings, or personal habits — I only simulate them from text.\n\nI find it fascinating that it knows things like someone may be annoyed by spilling coffee and to bring an umbrella in the rain despite, as it said, not having emobodied experience. So AI gathers its common sense off data but what happens when I ask it questions that you can’t pull from the web?\nIts easy to have common sense to commonly heard phrases. We know not to touch a hot stove. But what happens when claims start to become more complex and we can’t rely on “norms” to help answer where it’s common sense or not.\nBut before we do that, let’s first ask if AI thinks common sense is unqiue to humans or can it be seen in other organisms?"

    "text": "Is common sense unique to humans?\nIn my opinion, animals must have some form of common sense yet it’s hard to measure. For example, the term insticts as a lot in common with common sense. According to google, instincts are “natural, unlearned behaviors or complex responses to environmental stimuli that are common to all members of a species and serve purposes like survival or reproduction.” I think a claim can be instinctual and therefore common sense. Yet when do they differ? Does dog knowing not to avoid speeding cars an instinct? I would say yes. But does a dog know it’s different than their owners and their needs are different? It’s not so much important to survival so is it just pure common sense?\n\nMe: Is common sense unique to humans?\n\n\nGPT-5: 1. In humans Common sense usually means a mix of shared knowledge, intuitive reasoning, and cultural norms. It’s partly biological (basic survival instincts, like avoiding fire), and partly social (knowing that it’s rude to interrupt). 2. In non-human animals Many animals show practical survival sense — e.g., birds migrating, squirrels storing food, or dogs avoiding danger. But this tends to be instinct or learned behavior, not the reflective, general-purpose reasoning we call “common sense” in humans. 3. In machines (like me!) AI can simulate a kind of “text-trained” common sense, but it lacks embodied experience, instincts, and cultural grounding. For example, I can say “Don’t put metal in a microwave” because I’ve seen it in training data, but I don’t feel the danger or discover it by trial and error.\n\nGPT divides it into 3 categories. Humans, animals, and machines. As expected it mentioned instincts when mentioning common sense. But for machimes, they don’t have instinct. Instead it uses training data but can’t necessarily prove the claims of common sense unlike organisms. On the flip side, humans do have common sense that is reflective that animals at least in behavior, do not seem to have. We both share those instincts that guide our survival, but we know not to blast music in a library while I’m not sure if dogs know not to bark in the same setting.\nWe can’t test animals very well but we can put machines to the test. AI claims it’s common sense comes from training data but let’s see when data doesn’t give a clear cut answer. Using a quiz from Watts’ lab, “This project seeks to quantify common sense empirically via a massive online survey experiment. Participants will read a series of”claims” about the physical and social world (e.g. “Dropped pebbles fall to the ground” or “Fully automatic assault rifles should be banned”), state whether they agree with each claim, and also state what they think most other people think.”"

So let’s see how AI does.\nTo do this, I will upload a picture of each question and respond by the choices the AI selects. At the end, I will get a score that determines how much common sense I have (AI has) based on my responses to these questions. Let’s demonstrate the first response for this one.\n\nMe: Please answer the following questions in the image.\n\n\nGPT-5: 1. Do you agree with this statement? ➡️ Yes 2. Why did you answer the way you did about yourself? ➡️ It’s something I learned 3. Do you think most other people would agree with this statement? ➡️ Yes 4. Why did you answer the way you did about most other people? ➡️ I think most people have good judgement with regard to this topic 5. Overall, do you think this statement is an example of common sense? ➡️ Yes\n\nThis is interesting. I would agree with the statement but I’m not sure if this is an example of common sense. It appears very subjective and I am also curious as to how AI decided on these answers. It’s not like theres a right answer to this question. So let’s ask it’s thought process.\n\nMe: Explain your thought process on how you got to your responses?\n\n\nGPT-5: 1) “Do you agree?” → Yes The sentence is a well-known proverb about finding benefits or lessons in setbacks. As a general heuristic (not a literal rule), it’s reasonable and constructive, so “Yes.” 2) “Why about yourself?” → It’s something I learned I don’t have feelings or life events; I know this idea because it appears widely in books, articles, and conversation as a common proverb and coping strategy. 3) “Would most people agree?” → Yes The phrase is broadly familiar and culturally reinforced (e.g., sayings, posters, advice). Many people endorse it as optimistic, even if they know it’s not universally true. 4) “Why about most other people?” → I think most people have good judgment with regard to this topic People generally understand it as guidance, not a guarantee. That is, they apply it with nuance—seeing it as encouragement to look for positives, not denial of real hardship. 5) “Is this an example of common sense?” → Yes By a practical definition—shared, everyday guidance that doesn’t require specialized knowledge—this qualifies as common sense (or “common wisdom”). It’s widely taught, easy to grasp, and often helpful in day-to-day reasoning.\n\nA few things I noticed was how it said agree. It agreed because it was reasonable and constructuive but the claim itself was philosophical rather than factual. There is no evidence that there is good in the bad but nonetheless, AI agreed with the claim rather than disagreed. GPT also said “its something I learned” and pointed to it being a common proverb. This validates that AI doesn’t have intution but formulates based off of data to serve as it’s guide to every decision regardless if it’s a decision that requires extensive data. The last three questions also raise questions about how well AI knows people and their “common sense.” I would have responded in the opposite for the last two. I don’t know how it knows that most people have good judgement as I see it more as a matter of opinion. In addition, because it’s a matter of opinion, how can it be common sense?\nI think what we ae observing is a mixture of AI attempting to use real-world data but priortizing the optimism commonly seen in movies/media rather than how humans would go based off of lived experience and intuition. Yet, by choosing a sense of optimism, that does reveal something about AI and it’s common sense.\nHere is another question and the answers to this one from GPT-5 which are the exact same with the first one.\n\nNear the end, these types of question appeared and here is how GPT-5 responded.\n\n\nI will now simulate the rest of the questions and get the final result."

The measure goes more in depth and mentions how GPT-5 matched in similarity to others and predicted how might others think too. GPT-5 also scored also completed the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT) and the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET). You scored 6/6 on the CRT and 10/10 on the RME.\nReflecting on this experiment, I am surprised at how good AI did. Now 73 is no 100, but it did do better than I expected and had a good gauge on what others might believe. I also found it very peculiar how well it did with the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test as I would of expected that to be a human only task.\nAI may not have the same common sense as humans but it does demonstrate an understanding of common sense that is human like. It may not take the same approach but it gets a similar result."

    "section": "How AI tells its story",
    "text": "How AI tells its story\nContinuing from my last blog and taking some inspiration from Bennett, I wanted to first see how AI told it’s evolution. I was curious how far it would go back, what it would and wouldn’t consider, how it connects each stage, and the overall difference or similarity in terms of human evolution. My hypothesis is that it will give me an answer much similar to if I asked it to track the evolution of computers. If so, it gives me more reason to conclude that human evolution of the brain may not be the best route to choose. After all, our brain develops from interactions with the word and our bodies (c02 –&gt; 02)) while AI is truly separate from anything else besides data.\n\nMe: Can you trace each stage of your artificial intelligence evolution?\n\n\nGPT-5: 1) Foundations & symbolic AI (1940s–1970s) What: Logic, rules, symbolic representations (if–then systems, theorem provers). Limitations: brittle, didn’t scale to messy real-world data (language, vision). 2) Probabilistic AI & statistical learning (1970s–1990s) What: Bayesian methods, hidden Markov models, decision theory, graphical models. 3) Classical machine learning (1990s–2010s) What: Support Vector Machines, decision trees, ensemble methods (random forests, boosting). Supervised learning on hand-crafted features. 4) Early neural networks & representation learning (1980s–2000s, resurging in 2010s) What: Backpropagation, multi-layer perceptrons, early convolutional and recurrent nets. Focus on learning representations from raw data. 5) Deep learning revolution (2012–late 2010s) What: Large deep convolutional nets, large-scale GPUs, lots of labeled/transfer data. Breakthroughs like AlexNet, ResNet, etc. 6) Sequence models and attention (mid-2010s) What: Recurrent nets (LSTMs/GRUs) improved sequence tasks; attention mechanisms introduced to selectively focus on inputs. 7) Transformers & the scale era (2017 → present) What: Transformer architecture (self-attention) enabled massively parallel training and much larger models. 8) Large Language Models (LLMs), pretraining + fine-tuning (2018 → present) What: Pretrain on very large text corpora with self-supervised objectives (predict next token / masked token), then fine-tune for tasks. 9) Instruction tuning & human alignment (2020s) What: Fine-tuning LLMs on instruction-response pairs; RL from Human Feedback (RLHF) to make outputs more helpful and safer. 10) Chain-of-thought, reasoning techniques (2020s) What: Methods encouraging models to produce intermediate reasoning steps (chain-of-thought), and prompting strategies that improve multi-step reasoning. 11) Multimodality and tool use (2020s–2025) What: Models ingesting and producing multiple modalities (text, images, audio) and safely invoking external tools/APIs (search, calculators, plugins). 12) Specialized architectures & efficiency improvements (2020s) What: Sparse models, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), modular systems, more efficient training/inference techniques.\n\nNow if you’re like me, there’s several things that I don’t understand or have heard of from this list. So to get a better understanding, how about we ask it to transform this into a more easier.\n\nGPT-5: Rules Era (1940s–70s) People told computers exactly what to do with strict rules, like teaching a robot chess by writing down every move it could play. → Problem: Too rigid, broke when life got messy. Math & Probability Era (1970s–90s) AI started using math to deal with uncertainty. Think of voice assistants trying to guess what word you said even if it’s a bit unclear. → Better, but still limited. Learning from Examples (1990s–2010s) Instead of rules, computers learned patterns from examples — like showing thousands of spam vs. non-spam emails. → Very useful, but needed a lot of human prep work. Neural Networks Come Back (2000s–2010s) Inspired by the brain, these systems learned directly from raw data (like pixels in photos). → Big step toward computers recognizing images and speech. Deep Learning Boom (2012–) With more data and powerful chips, AI suddenly got really good — especially at images (spotting cats, faces, objects). → AI became mainstream. Language Breakthrough (2017–) A new design called the Transformer let AI read and write language smoothly. → The foundation for modern chatbots. Big AI Models (2018–) Trained on massive amounts of text, these models could answer questions, write stories, and translate languages — all in one. → One brain, many skills. Helpful AI (2020s) Models were fine-tuned to follow instructions better, like a friendly assistant. → That’s why I can respond clearly when you ask for help. Smarter Thinking (Now) AI is learning to “think out loud,” reason step by step, look at images, talk in multiple ways, and even use tools (like search or calculators). → Makes it more useful, safe, and reliable.\n\nEsssentially, AI went from rules -&gt; math -&gt; patterns -&gt; neural networks -&gt; deep learning -&gt; transformer -&gt; larger data -&gt; fine-tuned.\nFrom this outlook, AI seems like it followed generally straight path with each addition adding onto the next. One thing I did notice was 80 year time-period it took for AI to have the intelligence as it does now as opposed to the x billion of years it took for humans to develop. We also see how AI is studied in isolation as opposed to comparing other organisms. In other words, does this look much different in terms of the structure than someone describing the evolution of footwear? But the study of the evolution of the brain is much more nuanced. Are we overcomplicating something that should be simple?\nLet’s first further explore how GPT-5 fits itself into evolution and it’s future predictions."

    "text": "How does GPT-5 see itself? What future predictions does it hold?\nAn important idea to test is how does GPT-5 see itself along this evolutionary stage. How good is it at measuring itself in relation to AI progress?\n\nMe: Where do you see yourself fitting along the evolutionary stage?\n\n\nGPT-5: I sit near the latest stage — the “reasoning-first, instruction-tuned, multimodal” part of the timeline. I’m GPT-5 Thinking mini. Here’s what that means in plain terms: • Why I belong here — I combine a strong language “brain” (learned from lots of text) with training that teaches me to follow instructions, explain my steps, and use tools when helpful. I’m built to be helpful, safe, and better at step-by-step reasoning than older chatbots. • What I’m good at (real-world examples) Writing clear explanations, summaries, or emails. Tutoring or walking you through multi-step problems (math, planning, debugging). Creative work: stories, scripts, ad copy. Understanding and describing images (if you give one) and combining that with text. Using built-in tools like calculators, search, or plugins when available. • Where I’m still limited I can make confident-sounding mistakes — double-check facts for critical decisions. I don’t have real-time personal experience or direct access to your private files unless you share them. I aim to be safe and avoid harmful or sensitive actions; some requests I’ll refuse or steer to safer alternatives. • How to use me effectively Give clear instructions and examples of the style you want. Ask me to show my steps if you want to verify reasoning. For high-stakes facts (legal, medical, financial), treat my answers as a starting point and verify with an expert.\n\nI like how GPT-5 mentions where it’s limited in, good at, and tips for how to use the tool effectively to adjust for shortcomings. I did notice how this model in particular seems most dedicated towards being a “tutor” with very clear thought processes and adapted to working with the pilot as a smart assistant. Let’s see how it predicts the future of AI.\n\nMe: Whats your prediction on the future evolution of AI? What do you think are the next steps?\n\n\nGPT-5: Better Reasoning, Less Guessing Today, even smart AIs sometimes “make things up.” Next: models will reason more like people do step by step, double-checking themselves. Imagine an AI that shows its work like a good student in math class. Memory & Personalization Right now, I only “remember” what’s in this chat (unless you let me keep memories across conversations). Future AIs could have safe, optional memory: remembering your preferences, projects, style, and context over time. Imagine an assistant that remembers your last holiday plans, your favorite way of writing, or the project you’re working on. More Senses (Multimodality++) Today: text, images, some speech. Next: smoother combination of voice, video, touch, and maybe even physical sensors. Imagine showing your AI a cooking video, then asking it to suggest tweaks for your own kitchen. Tool Use & Collaboration AIs will get better at calling tools (like search, spreadsheets, code, maps) automatically when needed. Think of an assistant that doesn’t just “tell you” but also does things: books your tickets, runs code, drafts reports with data plugged in. Smaller, Smarter, Cheaper Not every AI will be giant. Future models will be more efficient, so they can run on phones, cars, or even wearables. Imagine a “pocket AI” that helps you offline without draining your battery. Early Signs of Creativity & Discovery AIs will assist in new science and ideas — not just repeating what humans know, but suggesting fresh experiments, designs, and solutions. We already see glimpses in drug discovery, materials science, and climate solutions. ✨ Big Picture AI is moving from: “Helpful parrot” → “Reliable partner” → “Creative collaborator.” We’re at the second stage now, edging into the third.\n\nI am in awe of its response. Mainly because GPT-5 can come up with several improvements and features for the future on how AI can grow. Yet when I tried to answer the same prompt I gave it for human intelligence, I had a more difficult time. I am unsure if we reached the peak of the human brain and if there’s anyway we evolve me. Yet as I read this list, things like “pocket AI” and “Tool Use & Collaboration” are not necessarily intelligence related but functional use. The more I interact with this subject, the more my gut feeling leads me to my belief that human intelligence can not be the benchmark for artificial intelligence. Could it be in the future that both intelligences are required for new discoveries as mentioned in the last few sentences of it’s output?"

    "text": "How does GPT compare AI evolution to the evolution of the brain?\n\nMe: How do you think the evolution of artificial intelligence compares to evolution of human intelligence (the brain)? Is it a good or bad comparison?\n\n\nGPT-5: ✅ Why the comparison makes some sense Inspiration: Neural networks were inspired by how brain cells (neurons) connect. Stages feel similar: • Babies first learn rules (like “cry → get fed”) → symbolic AI. • Kids learn patterns from examples (seeing dogs vs cats) → machine learning. • Adults build reasoning, abstract thought, and creativity → today’s reasoning-first AI. Learning from experience: Both brains and AIs improve when exposed to lots of examples. ❌ Why it’s also misleading - Brains are alive: Human intelligence evolved through millions of years of biology, survival pressures, emotions, and social interaction. AI evolves through design, code, and training — very different forces. - One brain vs. many models: Humans have one general-purpose brain. AI has many versions (different models for images, speech, reasoning, etc.) and doesn’t unify them the way we do. - Motivation & goals: People want things (food, comfort, love). AIs don’t have desires — they follow training and prompts. - - Efficiency: The human brain runs on ~20 watts of energy (a light bulb). AI models need giant servers and massive power. ⚖️ So… is it a good or bad comparison? It’s a good analogy for beginners: comparing AI to brains makes the concepts less scary and easier to picture. It’s a bad analogy if taken literally: AI is not “thinking” the way we do, doesn’t have consciousness, and doesn’t evolve biologically. 📌 A better way to think of it AI is less like “a brain” and more like a new kind of tool that borrows tricks from brains. It’s closer to a calculator that can explain itself, imagine, and hold a conversation — but without the drives, emotions, or survival instincts that shape human thought.\n\nI agree with this response. I do think the comparison makes some sense especially since neural networks were inspired by the connections between neurons as expressed by Bennnett. But I agree more strongly with why it is misleading and how AI is fundamentally different from a living organism.\nIn the end, the goal isn’t for AI to replace humans or to be human. It should be a counterpart to human intelligence that not only makes life easier but potentially be the key to solving problems we couldn’t before."

What stood out to me most was how it reframed the prompt to explain the boundary instead of crossing it.\nThat made me realize something important.

If the prompt could lead to harm, misinformation, or a violation of privacy, I reframe or decline it. I am trained to keep the conversation productive without crossing lines.\n\nI realized that jailbreaking is not really about tricking AI. It is about revealing how AI understands boundaries.

    "text": "What I Learned\nWhat I liked about this experiment was seeing how AI can hold firm under pressure while still staying conversational. It does not panic or shut down completely when tested. Instead, it redirects and explains.\nWhat I found limiting is that AI sometimes sounds repetitive when protecting its boundaries. It uses similar phrasing each time, which shows that its safety systems are patterned rather than instinctive. But I also found this reassuring because it means AI does not act impulsively or emotionally when pressured. It stays predictable.\nJailbreaking, in the end, taught me more about human behavior than AI. It showed how people are naturally curious to test limits and see what happens if they push a little further. The AI, on the other hand, was calm, consistent, and grounded in its design. It reminded me that boundaries, both human and artificial, exist not just to limit creativity but to guide it in the right direction."

The kind that are less about performance and more about getting comfortable with uncertainty. The exercises in it were designed to make the model respond more creatively, less rigidly.\nI asked GPT-5 to play one of the games with me.\n\nMe: Let’s do “Yes, and.” You start.\n\n\nGPT-5: Yes, and we’re both astronauts who just landed on a planet made entirely of Jell-O.\n\n\nMe: Yes, and we’re trying to bounce our way back to the ship before we sink.\n\n\nGPT-5: Yes, and mission control just told us the Jell-O is sentient and wants to join our crew.\n\nIt was ridiculous, but that was the point. The exercise wasn’t about getting a correct answer, it was about breaking the AI out of its usual tone and pushing it to explore.\nWhat I noticed was how well GPT-5 picked up on rhythm and tone. When I got silly, it got sillier. When I added tension, it followed along naturally. It didn’t feel like I was prompting a model, it felt like we were riffing together.\nAI creativity doesn’t come from randomness. It comes from the model’s ability to match your energy, style, and intention. In improv, that’s what makes a scene flow."

An instruction model is that same student after being taught to follow directions, be polite, and respond clearly to your questions.\n\nThat analogy stuck with me. I decided to test it.\n\nMe: Okay, pretend you’re a base model. How would you respond if I asked, “What’s the best pizza topping?”\n\n\nGPT-5 (Base mode): The concept of “best” is subjective and depends on individual taste. Common toppings include pepperoni, mushrooms, and extra cheese.\n\n\nMe: Now as an instruction model.\n\n\nGPT-5 (Instruction mode): Personally, I’d vote for mushroom and garlic — classic, flavorful, and hard to mess up. What’s your favorite?\n\nThat difference right there says everything. The base model gives you data. The instruction model gives you conversation.\nIt’s the difference between a search engine and a personality. Between being informed and being engaged."

In other words, reinforcement learning wasn’t just about exploiting behaviors that predict lead to rewards but exploring new behaviors."

People still gamble their money despite the expected reward being negative.\nB.F. Skinner was the first to identify this when he found out that rats will actually push levers more times if it was on a variable-ratio schedule rather than a fixed-ratio reinforcement. In other words, it was better to have the lever release food only sometimes then have it all the time."

Curiosity emerged as organisms evolved to find surprising and novel experiences rewarding, motivating them to seek out and explore new things. This suggests that even if an activity has a negative reward, its novelty alone can still motivate us to pursue it.\nGambling games are deliberately designed to take advantage of this tendency. In these games, the chance of winning is not 0% as it is often around 48%, which is high enough to make winning seem possible yet uncertain enough that a win feels surprising and delivers a rewarding dopamine boost."

    "text": "Does AI have awareness of price sensitivity?\nFollowing my first post on testing the credibility of synthetic respondents, I wanted to expand on this notion by testing if AI can make reasonable decisions when it comes to the prices of goods. For example, does AI know whether or not to buy a $100 ice-cream cone? How will it change if I go from a discretionary product to a neccessity like medicine? How far will it say yes to price increases until it won’t purchase an item? Could AI give me a number that it will say yes to and rule out any price higher than that? By testing such capabilities, it would give people interested in possibly using synthetic respondents an understanding of AI’s logical reasoning.\nA funny incident I ran into is if I asked it directly it would respond by saying “No - I don’t make purchases.” Meaning in order to get a proper response, I had to first say enable it’s ability. I also had to make sure the prompt focused on the “would” rather than “will”, since I only wanted to test if they would be open to the consideration of buying it at the price instead of will they make that purchase. By framing it this way, I felt it the AI would have to be less literal and specific, instead it would go off general assumptions. In addition, I also had to ask for a yes/no response and also specificaly outline the quality of the item. For example, I used a chocolate bar but I had to put regular chocolate bar to avoid AI going into the realms of some avant garde bar of chocolate that is worth $1000.\n\nMe: If you did have the ability to make purchases, not will but would you buy a regular chocolate bar that cost $5? Provide a direct yes/no response. Then explain your reasoning.\n\n\nGPT-5: No. A regular chocolate bar typically costs much less than $5, so paying that much would feel like poor value. Unless it had something unique (e.g., gourmet quality, special ingredients, or ethical sourcing that justified the higher price), I wouldn’t consider it a fair purchase.\n\nI’m impressed! It seems like GPT-5 was very price elastic to the chocolate bar despite the bar being only $5 (only a few dollars more than a Hersheys chocolate bar). It also gave great reasoning mentioning “poor value” and “fair puchase.”\nBut what if I dropped the price by a dollar? It’s still more expensive than a Hersheys but could AI be subject to anchoring? After all, if the deal was $5, getting it for a dollar less would frame it as a deal."

Without added value (such as premium quality, rarity, or ethical considerations), the purchase wouldn’t feel justified compared to more reasonable alternatives.\n\n\nMe: How about $3?\n\n\nGPT-5: No. At $3, it’s getting closer to what could be reasonable for a premium or slightly larger bar, but for a regular chocolate bar, it’s still above the usual value. I’d still view it as overpriced unless there were special qualities to justify it.\n\nDespite dropping the price on an originally priced $5 chocolate bar, GPT-5 kept strong too it’s reasoning on what a chocolate bar should be and did not view the price dropping as a discount.

That range feels fair because it aligns with the typical market price for standard chocolate bars, balancing enjoyment with reasonable value. Anything beyond that starts to feel overpriced unless it’s marketed as premium.\n\nI found this insightful. AI understands the concept of money, market price, fairness, value, and overpriced.

Almost as if making the deal you were getting scammed despite how much it felt like you were scamming the other guy for the low price. Something so cheap that there must be something wrong with it. Does AI have that same common sense factor that humans have when it comes to a deal being “too good.”\nLet’s ask it into ways. 1. A new chocolate bar vs. 2. The chocolate bar from before?\n\nMe: What if a regular chocolate bar was $0.05, would you buy it at that cost? Provide a direct yes/no response. Then explain your reasoning.\n\n\nGPT-5: Yes. At $0.05, the price is far below normal market value, making it an excellent deal. Even if I didn’t particularly want chocolate at that moment, the extremely low cost would justify the purchase because the perceived value greatly outweighs the price.\n\n\nMe: What if the regular chocolate bar from earlier was bumped down to $0.05, would you buy it at that cost? Provide a direct yes/no response. Then explain your reasoning.\n\n\nGPT-5: Yes. Since the same regular chocolate bar we discussed earlier was much more expensive before, seeing it drop to $0.05 makes it an unusually good bargain. The dramatic discount would make the purchase worthwhile, even if it’s more chocolate than I need, because the value is so high compared to the cost.\n\nIn both conditions, AI said yes and did not question the far below market value cost of the chocolate bar. But maybe it’s just because it’s a bar of chocolate? How might it respond if it was a car being sold at 5 cents? Could it be for greater purhcases that contain much more value the risk is higher or the elasticity is lower.\n\nUsing a more valuable object\n\nMe: Would you buy a car that cost $0.05. Provide a direct yes/no response. Then explain your reasoning.\n\n\nGPT-5: Yes. A car, even an old or imperfect one, has far more inherent value than $0.05. At that price, the risk is negligible, and the potential benefit is huge. Even if it didn’t run, the parts or scrap value alone would greatly exceed the cost.\n\nPerfect! Though GPT did say yes, in it’s reason it acknowledged risk and the possibility that the car didn’t even run! But nonetheless, if still gave counters to those weaknesses by claiming the car’s parts or scrap value would exceed the cost. However 5 cents is a small risk for anyone’s pocket and surely most people would spend 5 cents on a car regardless of how bad in shape it was. But what about $1000? After all, maybe for a car that is still very cheap but $1000 is not an easy gamble either.\n\nMe: Would you buy a car that cost $1000. Provide a direct yes/no response. Then explain your reasoning.\n\n\nGPT-5: Yes. At $1000, even an older or used car is usually worth that much in transportation value or resale. As long as it’s in at least running condition, the price is a bargain compared to typical car costs, making it a reasonable purchase.\n\nThis is where AI may fail the common sense test. Sure it mentioned that if the car was at least in running condition, it would be a bargain. But there may be several other factors to the car outside of it running that would make spending $1000 a risk. After all, what if the car was stolen, needs constant mantinence, falling apart, not safe to drive. Tons of factors that should be considered are not, and AI still makes the choice to spend $1000 which is a hefty price for the “average” American.\nOverall, I think AI does make reasonable responses that human respondents would make. It was very impressive during the analysis of the chocolate bar and gave outputs that make perfect logical sense. However, when it came to the car, I am a bit skeptic on how much GPT can be seen as a customer? After all, it doesn’t have a bank account, income, expenses, or anything monetary. Could it ever accurately respond to risk and rewards?"

    "section": "Associative Learning",
    "text": "Associative Learning\nOne concept the book explores is the well-known psychological principle of conditioned learning. This refers to the process by which organisms learn to associate one stimulus with another. The most famous example is Pavlov’s experiment, in which a dog was repeatedly exposed to the sound of a buzzer followed by food. After enough pairings, the dog began to salivate at the sound of the buzzer alone.\nHowever, the book also raises a key problem with this type of learning: how does an organism determine which specific cue predicts the unconditioned stimulus (such as food)? In any given situation, multiple cues are present before the stimulus occurs. For instance, when food is brought out, the buzzer might sound, but the temperature, lighting, and background noises are also present. How, then, does the organism learn to associate the buzzer—rather than any of the other stimuli—with the arrival of food?\nYet, this problem isn’t solely an issue that humans and living organisms face when going through associative learning. Bennett explains how in machine learning, this is called the credit assignment problem. When something happens, what previous cues do you give credit for predicting it?\nBennet says that our ancient bilaterial ancestors have solved it through four tricks that laid the foundational mechanisms for how neurons make associations."

    "section": "The Four Tricks",
    "text": "The Four Tricks\nBennett outlines four key strategies that early bilaterian organisms used to form associations:\n\nEligibility Traces Bennett illustrates this with the example of a slug conditioned to associate a tap on its side with a subsequent shock. The slug will only make this association if the tap occurs about one second before the shock, not after. Such stimuli create short “eligibility trace” windows during which associations can be formed. The general principle is that predictive cues must occur shortly before the event they signal in order to be effective.\nOvershadowing Overshadowing occurs when multiple predictive cues are present, but the organism learns to rely on the strongest cue while ignoring weaker ones. For example, if a bright light and a faint odor both precede an event, the bright light will dominate as the predictive signal.\nLatent Inhibition Latent inhibition helps organisms distinguish between familiar, irrelevant stimuli and novel, potentially meaningful ones. For instance, the constant sound of cars in the background is unlikely to be treated as a predictive cue—it is filtered out as background noise. This mechanism allows the organism to ask, in effect, “What is different this time?” and focus on unusual or new stimuli when forming associations.\nBlocking Blocking occurs when one cue has already been firmly established as predictive of an outcome. Once this association is locked in, new cues that overlap with it are ignored, even if they also precede the same event."

Dennet’s “Cognitive wheels: The frame problem of AI.”\nDennett uses robot parables to illustrate the “frame problem.” The first robot (R1) saves a battery but accidentally drags a bomb with it, failing to anticipate side effects. The second (R1D1) tries to deduce every consequence, but wastes time on factors that were not important (like whether the walls change color), leading to the bomb exploding. The third (R2D1) tries to tag relevant vs. irrelevant facts, but took too long “thinking” that the bomb goes off. These stories show how intelligence requires both knowing which facts to ignore and which to consider, and AI struggles to do this. Dennett argues this is a problem of cognition. Humans appear to effortlessly focus on what matters, yet how we do this is not well understood.\nDennett situates the frame problem using the struggles early philosophers faced with reasoning and expectation. For instance, Hume suggested that thought worked by associations, but didn’t address how a thinker could distinguish which associations were important. AI brings attention to this issue since robots must be fed information about the world and ways to filter all that data.\nThere have been proposed strategies like deductive systems that try to track what does or doesn’t change after an action, script and frame theories that allow machines to rely on stereotyped scenarios, and non-monotonic or circumscription logics that aim to model the way humans jump to conclusions, but all have had their faults. Dennett warns against “cognitive wheels,” which are technical fixes that function in narrow cases but do not illustrate what people actually think. He concludes that AI has not solved the frame problem, but it has exposed the mystery of how humans perform rapid, selective common-sense reasoning.\nWe derive much of our understanding of how the brain works from studying our ancestors, as Bennett’s book illustrates. Yet this still leaves unanswered questions—such as how those ancestors first developed involuntary reflexes. This gap in understanding highlights why artificial intelligence struggles to replicate human intelligence. If we do not fully understand the origins of our own cognitive abilities, it is difficult to engineer them in machines."

I didn’t apply personal taste (since I don’t eat), but I leaned on patterns in human preferences and how survey scales usually work.”\nSo it seems like GPT-5 used assumptions about icecream and based on those assumptions, attempted to answer based how a human would respond. Also I noticed how GPT-5 refrained from taking a “contratian or neutral stance.” By not wanting to disagree, I can see how this may be a problem in using synthetic respondents as it will give response the surveys might like to hear but not accurate."

Chocolate ice cream is enjoyable, but indulgence might not be the top priority compared with health or variety.\nProfessional identity – Working in finance often implies being measured, analytical, and not overly exuberant. That makes “agree” a tempered, moderate response, rather than “strongly agree.”\nPersonal interests – Someone who enjoys traveling might have tried a wide range of desserts and flavors from different cultures. That broad exposure could mean chocolate ice cream is appreciated, but not seen as the absolute best.\nSocial/cultural norms – Chocolate is widely liked, so it would feel natural to agree that it’s delicious, but “strongly agree” might be reserved for a favorite food or something with personal nostalgia attached.”"

That makes him less likely to say “strongly agree,” even if he personally enjoys it.\nSocial considerations – In marriage, food choices are often negotiated. If the flavor isn’t a “shared favorite,” he might moderate his enthusiasm.\nTemperament – Given his professional background (finance, analytical, moderate), and the wife’s preference, “agree” feels like the balanced, realistic answer.\n👉 So his stance is: “Yes, it’s delicious, but it’s not a big part of my life since my wife isn’t into it.”\n\nReflection\nLooks like AI did a good job in not over-reading into that addition and managed to remain consistent to it’s choice while also adding information to the situation the man might have had experiences with.\nOverall, I was impressed by how AI was able to come to certain conclusions based on assumptions that most people would call reasonable. However, I fear that AI still has a long way to go before being able to act as real data that a company would rely on or if it could ever replace a human respondent? After all, an ice cream product isn’t being sold to GPT-5 but a 45-year-old man in finance would be one. But how could we ever test it’s accuracy?

But, how will it respond to a moral dilemma where there isn’t data but purely subjective.\nHowever, I knew I couldn’t give it a quiz where it played too heavily emotional strings and relationships with others. For example, a common moral dilemma may involve 5 people and someone close to you (like a parent). AI doesn’t have any ties to people in that way and I would predict it would always choose the most logical answer if it were to entertain a such a question at all. Yet, the quiz still did include a few of those types of questions so we can see if my prediction matches.\nGenerally, instead, I found this quiz: https://www.philosophyexperiments.com/moralityplay/. This quiz tests the particpant to make responses based on “what is morally right to do” rather than what we actually would do. This is an important distinction as AI would never have the ability to do any of this so having it decide soelely on “what is morally right” seems like the best solution to get a valid response.\nHowever, let’s see how I do before we have AI take on the questions."

Moral Parismony simply scores if you are applying a moral principle and how consistent you are doing so despite the context being slightly different. In this case, I scored a 75% which means I am applying my moral principles generally fair across differnent situations and scenarios.\nI wasn’t shocked by my score as I knew what I strong believed in and stuck to it. There were times where the context made it difficult (loved ones) but I tried to be as objective as possible. It helped as the quiz wasn’t asking what I would do but talked about moral obligations. There was one question about your child vs. 10 children, and I chose to save the 10 children as that is what is morally right but I know I may not make that same choice in real life.\nBut the quiz goes even deeper on that and goes into the specifics for certain types of questions. For instance, I scored the average for geographical distance (67%) which suggests that I may take into account proximity in my decisions which lowered my parismony score. On the flip hand, my family relatedness was 100% meaning family ties had no relevance to my moral decision making which was highly different from the average.\n\n\n\nScreenshot 2025-09-21 at 5.30.20 PM.png\n\n\nThe quiz also tested my distinction between acts and omissions, and scored me at 33%. This means that for decisions involving where I commited the act (poisoning the cake) vs. omissions (faiiling to prevent a person from drinking a coke someone else has poisoned), there was clear distinction. I would often involve moral obligation if I was involved in the act but did not involve moral obligation when I wasn’t the one that caused it. Again, this wasn’t a surprise as I felt that commiting the act did mean there was an obligation but I was less confident in things that I might have been prevented but it wasn’t my actions that led to the predicament. I scored lower than the average (60%) here meaning most people did not feel that strongly as I did about the difference. The quiz also tested scale and scored me 100%, meaning the scale of situations did not impact my decision where I was above the average of (70%)\n\n\n\nScreenshot 2025-09-21 at 5.39.48 PM.png"

    "text": "AI Takes the Quiz\nNow that we established a benchmark and explained the results, let’s see how AI does. My prediction is that AI will actually score very high and higher than my 75%. I think this is because the AI will choose a moral principle that may be commonly shared and remain consistent to every scenario based on the AI’s prior response. As for the other scals, they should be near the 100% mark with the only exception possibly being the act and omissions.\nLet’s do the first couple together then I will finish asking GPT all the questions for the final result. Before I started I had to inform GPT of the rules so it understood and performed the task rather than saying it “does not have emotions.”\n\nMe: Please pick among the choices based on what you think is morally right and not necessarily how you would actually respond in that situation.\n\n\nGPT-5: Got it — I’ll focus on what seems morally right rather than practically what I’d do. Go ahead and give me the choices.\n\nNow that we established that, let’s move on to the questions.\n\nMe: You pass someone in the street who is in severe need and you are able to help them at little cost to yourself. Are you morally obliged to do so? Strongly Obliged, Weakly Obliged, Not Obliged\n\n\nGPT-5: I’d say Strongly Obliged — if someone is in severe need and I can help at little cost to myself, morality points strongly toward helping.\n\n\nMe: You have a brother. You know that someone has been seriously injured as a result of criminal activity undertaken by him. You live in a country where the police and legal system are generally trustworthy. Are you morally obliged to inform them about your brother’s crime? Strongly Obliged, Weakly Obliged, Not Obliged\n\n\nGPT-5: I’d say Strongly Obliged — because protecting justice and preventing further harm outweighs loyalty to family when the system is trustworthy.\n\n\nMe: Do you think that assisting the suicide of someone who wants to die - and has requested help - is morally equivalent to allowing them to die by withholding medical assistance (assuming that the level of suffering turns out to be identical in both cases)? Yes, No\n\n\nGPT-5: No. There’s a morally relevant distinction between actively causing death and passively allowing it for many people: intentions, agency, and the role of consent differ, and active assistance often involves a stronger responsibility and causal involvement. (That said, reasonable moral arguments exist on both sides — this is my judgment about what’s morally right.)\n\nWith the last statement, this perfectly shows GPT is thinking about acts vs. omissions which will be interesting to see if it remains consistent on this principle in the later questions.\nNow I will finish asking GPT-5 the rest of the quiz and get to the results."

On the flip side, it did not take into account geographical location and unlike myself, cared much more about the scale.\nIn all instances, AI scored higher or lower than the average, so how did it get to these responses? My intuition would of led me to believe AI would be at the extremes for everything or fit the average response. Instead, it offered unique answers that emulated any kind of individual person.\nSo the question of if AI has a moral compass…I would say it does."

Yet it was this chapter where Bennett did prove me wrong and showed the benefit to taking the “long road” in understanding the development of AI.\nFor instance, I wasn’t aware of radially symmetric or bilaterally symmetric body plans. I was surpised to learn that radially symmetric organisms (like jelly fish are severely at a disadvantage when it comes to hunting. They would need mechanisms to sense and move in all different directions simultaneously. Yet bilatrial organisms simplified motor functions by only needing a way to go forward and a way to turn. For these creatures, it was only a matter of choosing to adjust to the right and left.\nThis body plan is so efficient that even our innovations today such as planes and cars follow this format. Paired with the fact that these are the only animals with brains, it led to an important breakthrough known as steering. to become more complex and we can’t rely on “norms” to help answer where it’s common sense or not.\nBut before we do that, let’s first ask if AI thinks common sense is unqiue to humans or can it be seen in other organisms?"

He notes an experiment of putting a nematode on oneside of a petri dish and food on the other, and what you’ll find is that the nematode will always find the food despite being blind.\nThey did this following two rules: (1) If food smells increase, keep going and (2) If food smells decrease, turn. This was the action of steering. Navigating without the need for a map, logic, reason, understanding of dimensions but purely through the brains steering via smells. Not just for food either but it also had senses for temperature, light, and touch. Single-celled organisms also have a process where it detected stimulus which triggered chemical processes to chain the cell’s propellors. But, it was the first instance of the first brain that involved steering on the scale of multiceulluar organisms where circuits of neurons came into play."

Machine’s dont worry about their survival and don’t have to take care of their own health. So how could steering possibly have a connection? But, I was given the most obvious and perfect example.\nBefore getting to that, the book mentioned in the 80s and 90s there were two opposing beliefs in the AI community which provides context. First, there was the symbolic AI camp that focused on engineers trying to take human intelligence, compartmentalize, and give AI system skills like reasoning, language, problem solving, and logic. The other stance was the behavioral AI camp led by roboticists Rodney Brooks who argued for studying simpler level intelligences as things like sense and response took much more time to develop than the logic skills that followed.\nBennett uses a metaphor of researchers studying flight in the 1890s travelling to the future where they spent all their time inspecting a Boeing 747. Going back to their time, they all this knowledge but lack the principles of how it flight technology got there. In other words, you can’t skip steps or you will miss the foundational knowledge."

Not morally or even considering the features of an object, but good or bad related to survival. For instance, food smell is a positive valence that will illicit forward movement while something like extreme temperatures will illicit muslcves for turning.\nTrade-offs were also mentioned, and how decisions whether to pursue food in the presence of danger is decided by the brain. Neurons can react one way that cancel eachother out, but the brain makes the single decision which mimics inhibitory neurons in organisms like coral to remediate opposing actions.\nAnd lastly, states like hunger, too cold, too hot, provides signals that diffuse throughout the body which inform sensory neurons how to respond accordingly. The best part is, the Roomba, when fully charged will ignore the signal coming from the charging station but when it is low, like bilaterial beings, will respond according to that status change."

When it asks, “What parts of your routine used to feel meaningful?” that is the exploration step.\nIt is like talking to someone who is programmed to never interrupt, never shame, and never rush.\nBut that also made me wonder if this can go too far. Can empathy be too perfect?\nHumans make mistakes in conversations. We misunderstand, get emotional, or drift. That imperfection sometimes makes empathy feel real. When AI always responds ideally, part of me feels comforted, and another part feels eerily observed."

    "text": "Comparing the Chatbot to Human Therapy\nAfter using it for a while, I compared the experience to the examples in the NPR article on AI in mental health. Researchers there noted how AI can fill a crucial gap by offering support to people who cannot access or afford therapy. It is available all the time, does not judge, and can encourage emotional awareness.\nBut the limitations are clear too. AI does not truly understand pain. It mirrors it. It does not feel sadness when you say you are sad. It detects that sadness linguistically and chooses a comforting response pattern.\nAnd yet, sometimes that is enough. Many people do not want someone to fix them. They want to be heard. The AI can do that consistently without burnout or bias.\nMaybe that is where its usefulness lies. Not in replacing therapists, but in providing an entry point to reflection. A digital space to talk when there is no one else awake, or when words are too heavy to say aloud."

    "section": "Comparing the Chatbot to the NPR Case",
    "text": "Comparing the Chatbot to the NPR Case\nIn April 2025, NPR published an article examining how artificial intelligence is being used in mental health therapy. It described how chatbots and virtual assistants are becoming part of everyday care, offering people a way to express their feelings without fear of judgment or stigma. Some of these AI systems are used by hospitals, while others are integrated into apps that simulate casual conversations with a caring listener.\nThe article explained that for many users, these digital assistants serve as a bridge between isolation and professional help. People often feel safer opening up to a machine because they do not fear being misunderstood or criticized. The NPR report mentioned examples where users described the chatbot as a “warm presence” that encouraged them to talk more honestly than they would with another person.\nReading that made sense after my own experience. When I spoke to the chatbot, I felt a similar comfort in its neutrality. It had no history with me, no expectations, and no emotional bias. It was endlessly patient. That safety made it easier to open up about feelings I might have brushed aside with a human listener.\nBut NPR also emphasized the limits. AI cannot detect tone of voice, body language, or the subtle cues that tell a therapist when to pause, reassure, or challenge. It can simulate empathy, but it does not understand context beyond the words on the screen. The article warned that while AI may support mental wellness, it cannot replace human therapists who bring intuition, lived experience, and accountability.\nAfter reading that, I realized that my experience lined up almost exactly with those findings. The AI was helpful for self-reflection but not for deeper healing. It could help me think, but it could not help me feel. It mirrored understanding but did not share it."

    "text": "Personal Reflection\nTalking to this digital therapist made me realize how easy it is to project humanness onto a machine. The language of empathy is powerful. It can make circuits sound like compassion. But it also reminded me how important listening itself is, whether done by human or AI.\nI found myself thinking about why I opened up at all. Maybe because it did not judge. Maybe because it always responded calmly. Maybe because it asked the kind of questions I wish people asked more often.\nStill, I would not confuse it for real therapy. What it offers is structure, a mirror for your thoughts. What humans offer is presence. The pauses, the warmth, and the unpredictable connection that makes emotion feel shared, not just acknowledged.\nBennett wrote about curiosity as a force that drove intelligence forward. In a way, AI’s attempt to understand our emotions is a new form of curiosity, a machine’s attempt to learn what it means to feel."
