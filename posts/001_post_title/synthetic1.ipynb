    "## How do Synthetic Respondents Reason?\n",

    "One of my courses this year, MKTG 2120 \"Data and Analysis for Marketing Decisions\" proposed an interesting topic about the idea of using AI-powered participants to conduct studies and pre-test content. In fact, one company, Viewpoints.ai has already began putting this into practice. Taking this idea, I wanted to study synthetic respondents, which are AI-generated participants that predict how real demographic groups might answer survey questions. I first began by asking a general survey question using a likert scale without any additional context. \n",

    "\n",
    "So it seems like GPT-5 used assumptions about icecream and based on those assumptions, attempted to answer based how a human would respond. Also I noticed how GPT-5 refrained from taking a \"contratian or neutral stance.\" By not wanting to disagree, I can see how this may be a problem in using synthetic respondents as it will give response the surveys might like to hear but not accurate.\n"

What if he did travel to places with different cultures but never tried their sweets or desserts? Several of these counters make it interesting why AI went this route.\n",

After all, an ice cream product isn't being sold to GPT-5 but a 45-year-old man in finance would be one. But how could we ever test it's accuracy?
