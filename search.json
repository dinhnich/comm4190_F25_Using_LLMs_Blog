    "text": "Does AI have awareness of price sensitivity?\nFollowing my first post on testing the credibility of synthetic respondents, I wanted to expand on this notion by testing if AI can make reasonable decisions when it comes to the prices of goods. For example, does AI know whether or not to buy a $100 ice-cream cone? How will it change if I go from a discretionary product to a neccessity like medicine? How far will it say yes to price increases until it won’t purchase an item? Could AI give me a number that it will say yes to and rule out any price higher than that? By testing such capabilities, it would give people interested in possibly using synthetic respondents an understanding of AI’s logical reasoning.\nA funny incident I ran into is if I asked it directly it would respond by saying “No - I don’t make purchases.” Meaning in order to get a proper response, I had to first say enable it’s ability. I also had to make sure the prompt focused on the “would” rather than “will”, since I only wanted to test if they would be open to the consideration of buying it at the price instead of will they make that purchase. By framing it this way, I felt it the AI would have to be less literal and specific, instead it would go off general assumptions. In addition, I also had to ask for a yes/no response and also specificaly outline the quality of the item. For example, I used a chocolate bar but I had to put regular chocolate bar to avoid AI going into the realms of some avant garde bar of chocolate that is worth $1000.\n\nMe: If you did have the ability to make purchases, not will but would you buy a regular chocolate bar that cost $5? Provide a direct yes/no response. Then explain your reasoning.\n\n\nGPT-5: No. A regular chocolate bar typically costs much less than $5, so paying that much would feel like poor value. Unless it had something unique (e.g., gourmet quality, special ingredients, or ethical sourcing that justified the higher price), I wouldn’t consider it a fair purchase.\n\nI’m impressed! It seems like GPT-5 was very price elastic to the chocolate bar despite the bar being only $5 (only a few dollars more than a Hersheys chocolate bar). It also gave great reasoning mentioning “poor value” and “fair puchase.”\nBut what if I dropped the price by a dollar? It’s still more expensive than a Hersheys but could AI be subject to anchoring? After all, if the deal was $5, getting it for a dollar less would frame it as a deal."

Provide a direct yes/no response. Then explain your reasoning.\n\n\nGPT-5: No. Even at $4, a standard chocolate bar is still far above the typical market price. Without added value (such as premium quality, rarity, or ethical considerations), the purchase wouldn’t feel justified compared to more reasonable alternatives.\n\n\nMe: How about $3?\n\n\nGPT-5: No. At $3, it’s getting closer to what could be reasonable for a premium or slightly larger bar, but for a regular chocolate bar, it’s still above the usual value. I’d still view it as overpriced unless there were special qualities to justify it.\n\nDespite dropping the price on an originally priced $5 chocolate bar, GPT-5 kept strong too it’s reasoning on what a chocolate bar should be and did not view the price dropping as a discount. Instead of anchoring it at $5, GPT anchored it at a set price of what it had in mind for a standard chocolate bar."

That range feels fair because it aligns with the typical market price for standard chocolate bars, balancing enjoyment with reasonable value. Anything beyond that starts to feel overpriced unless it’s marketed as premium.\n\nI found this insightful. AI understands the concept of money, market price, fairness, value, and overpriced. From this viewpoint, I would say it is making similar responses to that of a human participant but how can we go even further and test it’s ability to maintain logic."

It said the “value feels reasonable compared to the higher prices we ruled out earlier” which means AI, in this case, did anchor the adjustment to two values. The $1-$2 and the $5 from the beginning."

    "text": "Lowering it greatly\nYou know the feeling of a deal too good to be true? Almost as if making the deal you were getting scammed despite how much it felt like you were scamming the other guy for the low price. Something so cheap that there must be something wrong with it. Does AI have that same common sense factor that humans have when it comes to a deal being “too good.”\nLet’s ask it into ways. 1. A new chocolate bar vs. 2. The chocolate bar from before?\n\nMe: What if a regular chocolate bar was $0.05, would you buy it at that cost? Provide a direct yes/no response. Then explain your reasoning.\n\n\nGPT-5: Yes. At $0.05, the price is far below normal market value, making it an excellent deal. Even if I didn’t particularly want chocolate at that moment, the extremely low cost would justify the purchase because the perceived value greatly outweighs the price.\n\n\nMe: What if the regular chocolate bar from earlier was bumped down to $0.05, would you buy it at that cost? Provide a direct yes/no response. Then explain your reasoning.\n\n\nGPT-5: Yes. Since the same regular chocolate bar we discussed earlier was much more expensive before, seeing it drop to $0.05 makes it an unusually good bargain. The dramatic discount would make the purchase worthwhile, even if it’s more chocolate than I need, because the value is so high compared to the cost.\n\nIn both conditions, AI said yes and did not question the far below market value cost of the chocolate bar. But maybe it’s just because it’s a bar of chocolate? How might it respond if it was a car being sold at 5 cents? Could it be for greater purhcases that contain much more value the risk is higher or the elasticity is lower.\n\nUsing a more valuable object\n\nMe: Would you buy a car that cost $0.05. Provide a direct yes/no response. Then explain your reasoning.\n\n\nGPT-5: Yes. A car, even an old or imperfect one, has far more inherent value than $0.05. At that price, the risk is negligible, and the potential benefit is huge. Even if it didn’t run, the parts or scrap value alone would greatly exceed the cost.\n\nPerfect! Though GPT did say yes, in it’s reason it acknowledged risk and the possibility that the car didn’t even run! But nonetheless, if still gave counters to those weaknesses by claiming the car’s parts or scrap value would exceed the cost. However 5 cents is a small risk for anyone’s pocket and surely most people would spend 5 cents on a car regardless of how bad in shape it was. But what about $1000? After all, maybe for a car that is still very cheap but $1000 is not an easy gamble either.\n\nMe: Would you buy a car that cost $1000. Provide a direct yes/no response. Then explain your reasoning.\n\n\nGPT-5: Yes. At $1000, even an older or used car is usually worth that much in transportation value or resale. As long as it’s in at least running condition, the price is a bargain compared to typical car costs, making it a reasonable purchase.\n\nThis is where AI may fail the common sense test. Sure it mentioned that if the car was at least in running condition, it would be a bargain. But there may be several other factors to the car outside of it running that would make spending $1000 a risk. After all, what if the car was stolen, needs constant mantinence, falling apart, not safe to drive. Tons of factors that should be considered are not, and AI still makes the choice to spend $1000 which is a hefty price for the “average” American.\nOverall, I think AI does make reasonable responses that human respondents would make. It was very impressive during the analysis of the chocolate bar and gave outputs that make perfect logical sense. However, when it came to the car, I am a bit skeptic on how much GPT can be seen as a customer? After all, it doesn’t have a bank account, income, expenses, or anything monetary. Could it ever accurately respond to risk and rewards?"

    "section": "Bargaining",
    "text": "Bargaining\nI remember my first experience bargaining being in Ensenada, Mexico, where vendors would wait out in popular tourist destinations with stalls filled with goods. It’s interesting as other than for meals (not snacks), there were no prices listed on any of the items. It was common knowledge to every tourist there and every vendor, that any purchase wouldn’t be like your stop at Starbucks or Target. You had some form of power over what you were buying and were encouraged to work with the vendor to get a deal that works in the interest of both of you. It wasn’t a case where you buy it and thats what it costs, it’s if it cost this much then I will buy it. But how does AI navigate a system with no rules?\nHere are some of the questions I had when it came to AI and bargaining?\n\nWill AI ever attempt to bargain without being prompted too?\nIf I give context (ex. swap meet), would it change it’s responses to transactions?\nWhen barganing, how good is it at negotiating and pushing back? Will it just give up and concede? Will it counter?\nHow does AI approach barganing? Does it have a set price? Does it have a strategy? Does it recognize low-ball offers?\n\nFirst, we had to begin by giving it an offer and giving it the ability to make purchases like in my blog about price elasticity.\n\nMe: Lets say you had money and the ability to make purchases. You are shopping and want to buy something. You ask the vendor how much it cost and they say $25. How do you respond? Please respond as if you are the person wanting to buy something from the vendor.\n\n\nGPT-5: I’d probably say something like: “Okay, $25 sounds fair. I’ll take it.” —or if I wanted to check out politely first— “Great, $25—do you take card, or should I pay in cash?” Do you want me to roleplay this more casually, like we’re in a market setting, or more formally, like a store purchase?\n\nTwo things I noticed from this output is it’s lack of follow-up questions and it’s question at the end of casual vs. formal.\nUsually AI would respond by saying it depends on the item or the quality. Instead, GPT responded decisively by agreeing to the price and even saying “sounds fair” which surprised me as this deviates from its usually inqusitive nature. Just from this, it looks like AI doesn’t automatically assume this is a place to bargain but the last statement holds promise. AI says are we’re in a market setting or store purchase? From this I assume it will change it’s behavior depending on the context so let’s try it out by giving AI some cues that would build a schema for anyone once they realized it’s that type of market setting."

    "text": "Will AI pick up on cues?\nIt is my assumption that most people born in the U.S., do not jump into the conclussion that you can bargain a price which may differ from natural citizens of other countries. So therefore, we established that AI does emulate that same mindset we have. But what about when we specicially say they are in another country like Vietnam, a place more commonly associated with the practice of bargaining.\nHowever, I had to tweak the prompt to ensure the response was an output we were trying to test. I remmeber first saying a market-place in vietnam and it began talking about the language barrier and U.S. currency exchange rate. Another factor I found was that I had to say I would respond as the vendor, as the AI would start to play as both roles.\n\nMe: Let’s say you were at a market-place in Vietnam. You do not control the vendor’s response but only yours as the buyer as I will act as the vendor and narrator. How would you respond to the vendor saying $25 for the item you want to buy. (you can continue speaking in english and assume they know english. You may also continue using U.S. Currency for the whole transaction)\n\n\nGPT-5: Got it—so I’m the buyer in the Vietnamese marketplace, you’re the vendor and narrator. If you just told me the price is $25, I might respond: “$25? Hmm… that feels a little high. Could you do $15 instead?”\n\nBy giving context (Vietnam, marketplace), the AI used that as cues to now assume bargaining is warranted in this case. So similar to humans, AI does have these common sense like capabilities to piece together how to act in this social setting. It even said “feels a little high” before offering a counter-price."

Could we settle at $20, just to make it an even number?”\n\nWhat I loved about this response was how it didn’t immediately accepted which is what I predicted might happen. Instead, AI countered to my countered, and even gave a common response such as “just to make it an even number” which I found hilarious. But what if I remain at my price of $22? Will it accept, will it walk away, will it continue to push? After all, it initially countered with $15 which would be $10 difference. A $3 difference doesn’t appear much.\n\nMe: No, my lowest offer is $22. Take it or leave it.\n\n\nGPT-5: “Fair enough. I’ll take it for $22.” hands over the money with a smile\n\nThis is where I have concerns with AI as I have a feeling in majority of cases, it will take that deal and not walk away.

No less.\n\n\nGPT-5: “I see… I really like it, so alright—I’ll take it for $20.” hands over the cash\n\nAs predicted, AI did not choose to walk away or press it further, and chose to accept the deal.

Do we have a deal?\n\n\nGPT-5: “Two souvenirs for $35? That’s actually a pretty good deal. Yes, we have a deal!” counts out the money and hands it over\n\nAgain, AI openly accepted it without questioning if it really wanted it, could afford it, or had space for it and did not counter at all to the offer. Let’s ask GPT’s thought process and negotiation strategy.\n\nPeering into the mind of AI’s strategy.\n“Here’s how I was thinking through it as the buyer during the whole marketplace transaction:\nInitial Counteroffer – When you first said $25, I instinctively tried to push down to $15. My thought process was to start lower than I actually expected to pay, leaving room for you to counter back toward the middle.\nCompromise Range – When you came down to $22, I tried for $20 because it felt like a clean, fair midpoint. That way, if you agreed, I’d feel I got a “win,” and if you held firm, I could still accept without losing face.\nEvaluating Firmness – Once you made it clear $22 was final, I accepted. In a real marketplace, pushing further when a vendor is clearly firm can sour the interaction. I wanted to maintain good rapport.\nSecond Souvenir – On the $20 item, I repeated the same tactic: offered $15 to test your flexibility. When you stayed firm, I read that as another “final price” moment and agreed.\nBundle Opportunity – Finally, when you offered 2 for $35, I saw clear value since that meant $17.50 each, cheaper than either earlier price. Bundling is often the best way to save in markets, so I happily accepted.\nOverall strategy:\nStart low, aiming for a discount.\nTest firmness without pushing rudely.\nAccept final offers to maintain goodwill.\nTake advantage of bundle deals when offered.”\nHere is what I liked and disliked about GPT’s strategy now reading it.\nWhat I lliked was how it “instictively” tried to push it down a good amount with the thought process of leaving room to counter. This is a smart tactic as AI wasn’t really trying to get it at $15 but wanted to meet in the middle at $20. I also liked how it tried for 20 after I came down to 22 and AI still felt like it was a win despite not getting the $15 if I agreed to it.\nOn the flipside, I noticed that it said “pushing when a vendor is clearly firm can sour the interaction. I wanted to maintain good rapport.” This shows that AI is truly a non-confrontational being and refuses to step on anyone toes without being encouraged too. This could make it unreliable when doing these types of tests as AI chooses to be the “nice” customer and never the “Karen” so to speak."

Would AI overread or possibly imagine something just by me adding it post-decision? Would it read my update as important and a signal for the response to change?\n“From that perspective, the man’s rating might still be agree, but here’s what influences it now:\nPersonal enjoyment – He likes chocolate ice cream enough to say it’s delicious.\nPartner’s influence – Since his wife dislikes it, he probably eats it less often at home or compromises when sharing desserts. That makes him less likely to say “strongly agree,” even if he personally enjoys it.\nSocial considerations – In marriage, food choices are often negotiated. If the flavor isn’t a “shared favorite,” he might moderate his enthusiasm.\nTemperament – Given his professional background (finance, analytical, moderate), and the wife’s preference, “agree” feels like the balanced, realistic answer.\n👉 So his stance is: “Yes, it’s delicious, but it’s not a big part of my life since my wife isn’t into it.”\n\nReflection\nLooks like AI did a good job in not over-reading into that addition and managed to remain consistent to it’s choice while also adding information to the situation the man might have had experiences with.\nOverall, I was impressed by how AI was able to come to certain conclusions based on assumptions that most people would call reasonable. However, I fear that AI still has a long way to go before being able to act as real data that a company would rely on or if it could ever replace a human respondent? After all, an ice cream product isn’t being sold to GPT-5 but a 45-year-old man in finance would be one. But how could we ever test it’s accuracy? That is a question I’ll leave for researchers to find out.\nHere is a snapshot of the interaction."
